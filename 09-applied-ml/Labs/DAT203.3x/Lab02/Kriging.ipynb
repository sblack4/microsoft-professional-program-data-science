    "# Applications of Data Science\n# Lab 2\n# Exploring Kriging of Spatial Data\n\n## Overview\nIn this lab you will work with heavy metal polution data, sampled from the delta of the Meuse River in Belgium. The values of metal concentrations are sampled at certain spatial points. The spatial sampling is not performed on a close-spaced regular grid. Therefore, spatial interpolation or kriging is used to create a map of the expected concentration of metal polution. Specifically, you will: \n\n- Load and examine the properties of these data.\n- Explore the spatial dependency using the variogram of the metal polution data.\n- Use kriging to interpolate and create a map of metal polution.\n\n## What you will need\nTo complete this lab, you will need the following:\n- A web browser and Internet connection\n- The lab files for this lab\n\n****\n**Note** To set up the required environment for the lab, follow the instructions in the Setup document from the Setup folder.\n****\n\n## Load and Examine the Data\nAs a first step, execute the code below to load the metal polution data set, and examine its contents. Execute the code in the cell below to have a first look at these data. "
