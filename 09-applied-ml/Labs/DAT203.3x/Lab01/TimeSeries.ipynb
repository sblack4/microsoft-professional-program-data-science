    "# Applications of Data Science\n\n# Lab 1\n\n# Exploring Time Series Data\n\n## Overview\n\nTime series models are used in a wide range of applications, particularly for forecasting. \n\nThis notebook contains lab material to familarize yourself with key aspects of time series analysis. You will perform analyses on a time series of California dairy data. Specifically, you will explore the structure of the time series and forecast the monthly production of fresh milk in the state of California. \n\nThis exploration is performed in two steps:\n\n- Explore the characteristics of the time series data.\n- Decompose the time series of monthly milk production into trend, seasonal components, and remainder components. \n- Apply time series models to the remainder component of the time series.\n- Forecast the production of monthly milk produciton for a 12 month period. \n\n## What you will need\n\nTo complete this lab, you will need the following:\n\n- A web browser and Internet connection \n- An Azure Machine Learning workspace\n- The lab files for this lab\n\n**Note** To set up the required environment for the lab, follow the instructions in the Setup document from the Setup folder. \n"
